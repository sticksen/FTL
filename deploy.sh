# Transfer Builds to Pi-hole server for pihole checkout
# We use sftp for secure transfer and use the branch name as dir on the server.
# The branch name could contain slashes, creating hierarchical dirs. However,
# this is not supported by sftp's `mkdir` (option -p) is not available. Therefore,
# we need to loop over each dir level and create them one by one.
